# XDA002 - LoRaWAN Liquid Flow Meter Project

Welcome to the XDA002 project! This repository is dedicated to our innovative solution designed for efficient liquid flow monitoring and data communication via LoRaWAN. By integrating the Heltec HT-CT62 module with MAX485, this project aims to offer a reliable and scalable approach to liquid flow measurement and data transmission.

## Project Overview

The XDA002 project combines the Heltec HT-CT62 module's advanced capabilities with the robustness of MAX485 communication, facilitating accurate liquid flow metering and seamless data upload to LoRaWAN networks. This solution is ideal for various applications, including water management, irrigation systems, and industrial liquid monitoring.

## Main Components

- **Heltec HT-CT62 Module:** Central to our project, this module provides the core processing and connectivity features, enabling efficient data handling and LoRaWAN communication.
- **MAX485 Interface:** Utilized for reliable data reception from the liquid flow meter, ensuring accurate measurement and robust data transmission.

## Liquid Flow Meter Integration

The integration process involves connecting the liquid flow meter to the Heltec HT-CT62 module via the MAX485 interface. This setup allows for the precise collection of flow data, which is then prepared for upload to the LoRaWAN network.

## LoRaWAN Data Upload

Data collected from the liquid flow meter is transmitted to LoRaWAN, offering wide-area connectivity and enabling remote monitoring and analysis of liquid flow metrics.
